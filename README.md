# PhoneBook-application

## Description
As mentioned above many times, this phonebook application can perform each and every 
operation that a phonebook should perform. From adding a particular to deleting and 
modifying it,we can perform everything in it. There are many ways In which this 
application can be executed , but here in our program we have mainly focused on “singly 
linked list”. Now there might be a question that why we are using this particular data 
structure in our project while we have easy to handle things like array. So the basic answer 
to this question is that we need to made this project in a way so that it can’t be just kept 
somewhere in a corner ,but to make it available for each and everyone . And it could only be 
possible when it would solve the problem or defaults in the previous programs. Our main 
thing while making this program was to reduce its space and time complexity. That is the 
reason we used linked list data structure instead of array
